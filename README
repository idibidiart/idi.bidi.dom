 idi.bidi.dom - Javascript Anti-Templating 
 
 "All the separation and none of the baggage" 
 
 What is it? 
 
 Data-Driven DOM "Templating" Without The Templates    
 
 How Does It Work?
 
 idi.bidi.dom (idom for short) works by caching the virgin innerHTML 
 (the Node Prototype) of all DOM elements (the Nodes) that have a 'idom-node-id' 
 attribute at window.onload or $(document).ready. Each Node must contain exactly 
 one direct child at time of caching, i.e. the Node Prototype, which must 
 contain special variables (in its inner/outer HTML) to be replaced, in global, 
 dynamic fashion, with JSON data (with the scope being the inner/outer HTML of 
 a newly created instance of the Node Prototype)
 
 The Node Prototype may hold an arbitrarily complex DOM structure, and one in 
 which Node(s) defined elsewhere in the DOM may be dynamically linked by 
 reference (called Linked Nodes)
 
 idom works by creating an instance of the Node Prototype and populating the 
 special variables in it with dynamic JSON data (where the JSON keys must 
 correspond to the special variables in the Node Prototype) and then inserting 
 the newly populated instance into the Node itself, using replace (default on 
 first insertion), append or prepend methods, as applied to the Node's entire 
 content (the virgin innerHTML or all populated instances of the Node Prototype
 that were previously inserted into the Node) or specific, previously inserted
 instance(s) of the Node Prototype.
 
 idom allows the DOM to be decomposed into Nodes each having a Node Prototype
 from which instances (copies) can be created, populated with JSON data and then 
 inserted into the Node (in append, prepend, and replace modes, with the 
 ability to target specific, previously inserted instances of the Node Prototype 
 or the Node's entire content, i.e. the entire set of instances of the Node 
 Prototype) and where the Node itself can be dynamically linked into other Nodes, 
 which can be linked into other Nodes, and so on...
 
 idom takes the DOM and adds data-bound variables, encapsulation, 
 multiple-inheritance and type polymorphism (with DOM structures as 
 implicit data types) without taking over the job of Javascript itself. 
 
 Examples: 
 
 Take a look at test.html
 
 See Notes under String.prototype._idomMapValues for the expected JSON format
 
 Main Invocation Pattern
 
 .idom$ 
 
 document.querySelector('#someNode').idom$(data [, options])
 
 behavior: creates new instance of Prototype Node using data to populate the 
 special variables in Prototype Node, then append/prepend to (or replace) 
 existing instance(s) in the Node
 
 >> data: {key: value, key: value, key: value, etc} 
 where the keys must match the idom node variables in the Node Prototype minus
 the idom$ prefix
 
 >> options: {mode: 'replace'|'append'|'prepend', targetSelector: value, 
 ownSelector: value, nodeSelector: value, targetState: value, ownState: value, 
 nodeState: value}
 
 if there no populated instances of Prototype Node exist (or if the Node's 
 innerHTML was deleted after or before populated instances of Prototype Node 
 were inserted) then append/prepend/replace will all replace the Node's 
 entire content (if targetSelector is supplied in this case it will throw 
 an error, so unless you are sure, you may want to call .$isPopulated() before 
 invoking this method with targetSelector or stateSelector options)
 
 targetSelector: optional idom-selector value for instance(s) of Prototpe Node
 to insert the new instance at in append and prepend modes. If null, then 
 append/prepend new instance at last/1st instance
 
 targetSelector: optional idom-selector value for instance(s) of Prototpe 
 Node to insert into in replace mode. If null, replace entire content of Node
 
 ownSelector: new value of idom-selector value for instance of Prototpe Node 
 being inserted
 
 ownState: new value of idom-state attribute for instance of Prototpe Node 
 being inserted
 
 targetState: optional idom-selector value for instance of Prototpe Node to in
 sert at in append and prepend modes targetState: optional idom-selector value
 for instance of Prototpe Node to insert at in replace mode
 
 nodeSelector: new value of idom-selector for the Node itself
 
 nodeState: new value of idom-state for the Node itself
 
 Other available are methods are 
 
 .idom$delete([options]) which can delete certain instances of the Node Prototype 
 or all instances children (this method is untested as of this release but it 
 should work fine, report bugs)
 
 .idom$isPopulated() may be queried before specifying targetSelector or 
 targetState to verify existence of populated instance(s) of Node Prototype 
 (the targets)
