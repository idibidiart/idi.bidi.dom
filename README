 * README:
 * 
 * This version works in Gecko and Webkit, not tested on IE
 *
 * idi.bidi.dom - Anti-Templating Framework For Javascript -- offers a radically
 * different way for interfacting with the DOM. In abstract terms, it takes the DOM 
 * and adds variables, variable memoization, encapsulation, multiple-inheritance and 
 * type polymorphism (with the Node Prototype as the user defined type) In logical 
 * terms, it offers a list-based API for creating, updating, and deleting predetermined 
 * DOM structures with the ability to dynamically link and directly access other 
 * predetermined DOM structures at any depth within them, thus giving us a simple and
 * consistent alternative to the DOM's hierarchical API and allowing us to reduce the 
 * amount of HTML as well as separate the HTML from our presentation logic.
 *
 *
 * Why use it?
 * 
 * idi.bidi.dom reduces HTML on a page to a minimum and places a simple and consistent
 * JSON API between presentation logic and the DOM
 * 
 * How does it work?
 * 
 * idi.bidi.dom allows the DOM to be decomposed into Nodes each having a 
 * Node Prototype of which instances (copies, with the same or entirely different data) 
 * may be created, populated with JSON data, inserted into --and deleted from-- the Node 
 * (with the ability to target specific, previously inserted instances of the Node 
 * Prototype or all such instances), and where each Node can be linked by reference into 
 * any number of other Nodes.
 * 
 * Additionally, idi.bidi.dom allows the cloning of each Node and all the populated
 * instances within it (including any Linked Nodes inserted into the host's Node Prototype 
 * and their populated instances) This means that we may re-use the same Node to create 
 * any number of differently populated Nodes.  
 *
 * Unlike other template-less DOM rendering frameworks, idi.bidi.dom does not attempt 
 * to take the place of Javascript itself nor does it add its own boilerplate; it 
 * simply gives Javascript more power by leveraging a simple and consistent interface
 * to the DOM. 
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * format: document.querySelector('#someNode').idom$(cloneId, data [, settings])
 * 
 * output: creates a new instance of Node Prototype using 'data' (json) to populate the 
 * special variables in the Node, then append/prepend to (or replace) existing 
 * instance(s) of Node Prototype in the Node
 *
 * cloneId: unique id for the future or current clone the data is intended for  
 *
 * data: {key: value, key: value, key: value, etc} 
 * where the key must match the variable name in the data minus the idom$ prefix
 *
 * settings: {mode: 'replace'|'append'|'prepend', targetInstanceId: value, instanceId: 
 * value}
 *
 * if there no populated instances of Node Prototype then append/prepend/replace 
 * will create a new instance of the Node Prototype (so if a targetInstanceId is supplied 
 * in this case it will throw an error, so call .$isPopulated() first to be sure before 
 * invoking this method with targetInstanceId, unless you know the node is populated)
 *
 * targetInstanceId: (1) idom-instance-id value for the instance of the Node Prototype to 
 * insert _at_ when in append and prepend modes. If null, append/prepend at last/first 
 * previously populated instance of the Node Prototype, or to start of the list if none 
 * were previously populated.
 *
 * targetInstanceId: (2) dom-instance-id value for instance(s) of the Node Protoype to 
 * replace when in replace mode. If null, replace all instances.
 *
 * instanceId: idom-instance-id value for instance of Prototype Node being populated. 
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 * 
 * Other available are methods are 
 *
 * .idom$delete([settings]) which can delete certain populated instances of the Node 
 * Prototype or all populated instances 
 *
 * .idom$isPopulated() may be queried before specifying targetInstanceId  
 * to verify existence of populated instance(s) of Node Prototype (the targets) 
 * 
 * idom$clone may be used to clone an entire node (including any linked nodes) after it's 
 * been populated)
 *
 **********************************************************************************
 *
 * About Events:
 * If the handler is defined on the node it will only have access to the node id. If it's 
 * defined on or in the node prototype it will have access to the instance id
 *
 * The context of 'this' inside the handler becomes the element the event is defined on 
 * (i.e. the cloned node or the node prototype instance within it), which is the normal 
 * way 'this' is handled in this context
 *
 * event handlers that are not defined using element attributes (e.g. onclick, onmouseover, 
 * etc) are not handled by idom at this time. Finding and cloning all event handlers that 
 * are attached via different means, like jQuery, will be supported in the future
