 * README:
 * 
 * This version works in Gecko and Webkit, not tested on IE
 *
 * idi.bidi.dom - Anti-Templating Framework For Javascript -- offers a radically
 * different way for interacting with the DOM. In abstract terms, it takes the DOM 
 * and adds variables, variable memoization, encapsulation, multiple-inheritance and 
 * type polymorphism (with the Node Prototype as the user defined type) In logical 
 * terms, it offers a list-based API for creating, populating, and de-populating 
 * predetermined DOM structures with the ability to link, directly access, populate
 * and de-populate other predetermined DOM structures at any depth within them, thus 
 * giving us a simple and consistent alternative to the DOM's native API while allowing 
 * us to reduce the amount of HTML as well as separate the HTML from the presentation 
 * logic.
 *  
 * Why use it?
 * 
 * idi.bidi.dom reduces HTML on a page to a minimum and places a simple and consistent
 * JSON API between presentation logic and the DOM
 * 
 * How does it work?
 * 
 * idi.bidi.dom allows the DOM to be decomposed into Nodes each having a Node Prototype 
 * with data-injected variables in their markup. Multiple instances of each Node (i.e. 
 * data populated versions, each with its own persisted data) may be created, populated 
 * with data, and inserted into --and deleted from-- the Node (with the ability to target 
 * specific, previously inserted instances of the Node or all such instances). Each Node 
 * may embed any number of other Nodes, at any depth within its markup.
 * 
 * Additionally, idi.bidi.dom allows the cloning of each Node and all the populated
 * instances within it (including any populated Linked Nodes that were embedded into the 
 * host's Node Prototype) This means that we could re-use the same host Node to create 
 * any number of differently populated Clones with nested Nodes, which allows us to
 * composite and nest DOM views.  
 *
 * Unlike other data-driven DOM rendering frameworks, idi.bidi.dom does not attempt 
 * to take the place of Javascript itself nor does it add its own boilerplate; it 
 * simply gives Javascript more power by offering a simple and consistent interface
 * to the DOM. 
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * format: document.querySelector('#someNode').idom$(cloneId, data [, settings])
 * 
 * output: creates a new instance of the Node using 'data' (json) to populate the 
 * special variables in the Node, then append/prepend to (or replace) existing 
 * instance(s) of the Node
 *
 * cloneId: id for the clone the data is intended for. This is omitted when operating on 
 * cloned nodes
 *
 * data: {key: value, key: value, key: value, etc} 
 * where the key must match the variable name in the data minus the idom$ prefix
 *
 * settings: {mode: 'replace'|'append'|'prepend', targetInstanceId: value, instanceId: 
 * value} // replace is default
 *
 * if there no populated instances of the Node then append/prepend/replace 
 * will create a new instance of the Node (so if a targetInstanceId is supplied 
 * in this case it will throw an error, so call .$isPopulated() first to be sure before 
 * invoking this method with targetInstanceId, unless you know the node is populated)
 *
 * targetInstanceId: (1) idom-instance-id value for the instance of the Node to 
 * insert _at_ when in append and prepend modes. If null, append/prepend at last/first 
 * previously populated instance of the Node, or to start of the list if none 
 * were previously populated.
 *
 * targetInstanceId: (2) dom-instance-id value for instance(s) of the Node Protoype to 
 * replace when in replace mode. If null, replace all instances.
 *
 * instanceId: idom-instance-id value for instance of Prototype Node being populated. 
 *
 *********************************************************************************
 * 
 * Other available are methods are 
 *
 * .idom$dePopulate([settings]) which can delete certain populated instances of the Node 
 * Prototype or all populated instances 
 *
 * .idom$isPopulated() may be queried before specifying targetInstanceId  
 * to verify existence of populated instance(s) of Node Prototype (the targets) 
 * 
 * idom$clone may be used to clone an entire node (including any linked nodes) after it's 
 * been populated)
 *
 **********************************************************************************
 *
 * About Events:
 * 
 * If a handler is defined on the node it will only have access to the node id. If it's 
 * defined on or in the node prototype it will have access to the instance id
 *
 * The context of 'this' inside the handler function is the element the event is 
 * defined on
 *
 * event handlers that are not defined using inline event handlers (like onclick, 
 * onmouseover, etc) are not handled by idom at this time. Finding and cloning all event 
 * handlers that are attached via different means, like jQuery, will be supported in the 
 * future
